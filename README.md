# mafia-role-selector
The Mafia role selector script writen with python 3.10

This is a simple one:
  - you can enter number of each role you wish to be able to pick.
  - there is a SUM button which shows the number of entered roles.
  - the script will generate a random list after clicking on the Deck button.
  - after that each player can pick a random role.
 
Warning:
  DO NOT CHANGE THE NAME OF THE PNG FILE AT ROLES FOLDER.
  DO NOT CHANGE VARIABLES HOWEVER YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.
  DO NOT CHEAT WHEN YOU ARE PLAYING.


In this script I used Tkinter library for GUI.
Roles name are fixed so don not change them. if you wish to make sure you will change .png files names too.
